# Aaron Centeno Portfolio

## Description

The project of the week the week was to create a professional portfolio for myself without the help of having a base code. This portfolio provides recent works and applications that I have completed both as a web developer and an audio technician. It provides a description of my college career as well as my professional career and what I am currently doing. Lastly, it provides methods of contact and a link to a pdf file of my resum√©.

### Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Github
* VS Code
* Google Developer Tools

### What I Learned

During this weeks challenge the grid element was very intimidating. Luckily, my tutor was able to help explain and further assist in telling me what the syntax of the grids styling was. There are numerous ways to tell a grid to span 8 columns and 8 rows. Of course it is always up to the needs of the content. For my portfolio the method I chose changed each time depending on the desktop web page, tablet web page and smart phone web page. Snippets are shown below.
            
            TABLET MEDIA QUERIE
        grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 175px;
        grid-template-rows: 100px 5em 150px;

            MAIN DESKTOP CSS
        grid-template-rows: 130px 5em 130px;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
